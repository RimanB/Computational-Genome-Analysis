* Page 53, the SRR Id of "mother" has a typo. The correct text should be:

This project contains samples from the same three individuals as above (daughter: NA12878–SRR622457; father: NA12891–SRR622458; mother: NA12892–SRR622459).

* Page 119, the description of how to calculate the SAM bitfield should be:
